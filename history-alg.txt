Saving HTTP history object algorithm.

All requests are stored in syncable / local storage as files. Chrome has implemented
syncable filesystem which will sync files between app's instances.
After a new file is created on one instance it will appear in another. Then sync
adapter will create an entry in database.

All steps are executed after user action (send or save).

After send action:


-- When response ready

- if no current history object exists
    -- create HAR object
    -- create UUID for file name
    -- extract metadata for indexedDB
    -- create indexeddb object
    -- insert into indexeddb
    -- insert into local / sync storage
- if current object exists
